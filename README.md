# What is Shiny?

Shiny is a lightning fast, fully documented and by far the-easiest-to-use-ever C/C++/Lua high-performance profiler with no extensive surgery for your existing projects. Results are smoothed and shown in run-time as a call-tree or sorted-by-time. Output is also renderable as graphs in Ogre3D and easily customized to any other graphics engine!

* Very very low overhead, extremely powerful and accurate high speed profiling
* Amazingly simple-to-use & flexible interface with lots of examples and docs
* Results are elegantly shown as call-graph or sorted-by-time and readable in run-time code
* On-the-fly smoothing averages for scientific or main-loop projects like game engines
* Rendering history graphs & nicely colored output in OGRE 3D or your custom engine
* Clean platform-independent, object-oriented and free-for-any-purpose source code
